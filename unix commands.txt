Unix Commands :
            - Unix commands are instructions you type into a Unix (or Unix-like) operating system's terminal to tell the computer what to do.
            - Unix is an operating system (like Linux and macOS are based on it).
            - The terminal (or shell) is where you enter these commands.
            - Each command performs a specific task — such as creating files, moving data, checking system status, or managing processes.

            - Can be combined with options and arguments:
